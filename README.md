#Monitoring Tool For Reduction Of Carbon Foot Print

The world is moving to a Low carbon centered economy. The countries on the planet and top 500 companies are already voluntary commited to reach net zero carbon. More carbon will mean higher prices. The price of the carbon credits will increase every year. Net Zero carbon is important. We are Witnessed over the last 2 decades before climate change becomes irreversible. Methane is a large contributor to global warming 84 times more potent than CO2 and there is a lack of accountability for large pollution events, especially by the coal/fossil and gas industry

With the advent of Latest Technology satellite imaging has recently allowed to keep track of methane emissions close to real-time. However, access to the data and the potential methane leak event is still complicated. We think we can make that simpler so people can be aware of new leaks as they arrive and enable them to take actions.

Objectives Achieved In This Project So Far are listed below 

practical, affordable, fast which also could give real time statistics of the world about carbon, at level of individuals and companies, countries, supporting to reach goals of carbon reduction and against climate change, in a world economy based on carbon. 5ire: the carbon exchange market the world needs.

What  Our Solution does

The Project  tool motive and intent  uses satellite data from (Sentinel 5P and other sources) to automatically detect new potential methane leaks by clustering abnormal emissions and linking them to the fossil infrastructure.

An easy UI allows then everyone to look at recent methane events and get more information on what happens: criticality of event, size, location, visual images.

We hope that gives an easy tool for people to track and then easily raise awareness on such events as they unfold

How we built the Project are listed below

1)Use Google Earth Engine to access Methane (CH4), IR and wind data
2)Detect methane anomalous level and extract all hotspots
3)Link these "hotspots" to the fossil infrastructure (mines, plants and pipelines)
4)Assess the link between the event and the infrastructure and create a criticality score for events
5)Automate the pipeline using Azure function so it refreshes daily

Ideation to Prototype Stage Challenging Aspects are listed below

1) Google Earth Engine is not so user friendly and exporting data from it is challenging
 2)Identifying methane clusters was challenging. We think we can still improve the detection with more 3)complex logic by better including infrared and with more complex models

Solution possibilities are listed below
1)Detect model for Methane hotspot linked to fossil infrastructure.
2) Developed an E2E pipeline on Azure for daily refresh.
3)An easy-to-use UI that run and gets refreshed automatically that can already be used.

Latest And Evolving Technologies Used are described as follows

1)Working with Geosatellite data is difficult due to the size and geospatial subtleties
2)Methane data is hard to access and any initiative to make it easier to work on it will be helpful to others.


Future Scope  for Monitoring and Reduction of Carbon Foot Print and  Methane Leaks are Listed as follows

 1)Trying to Evaluate the performance  and get feedback on current tools
 2)Work on improving model and especially how to best link detected events with a precise source
 3)Add a way to easily share detected hotspots to social medias (e.g. Twitter)
